# Instructions:
# The user should define the following variables before running the script:
# - `epsg_code`: The EPSG code for the coordinate system being used (e.g., UTM Zone 32N uses EPSG:25832).
# - `resolution`: The resolution of the output raster grid in meters (e.g., (-1, 1) means a 1-meter resolution in both X and Y directions).

# Define the EPSG code for the coordinate system (e.g., UTM Zone 32N uses EPSG:25832)
epsg_code = 25832  # Set the EPSG code for the desired CRS
# Define the resolution for the raster output (in meters)
resolution = (-1, 1)  # X and Y resolution (1 meter in both directions)

# Step 1: Set the directory containing the input files and the output directory for saving raster files
# directory: The path to the folder containing the .asc files.
# output_dir: The path where the generated raster files will be saved.

# Step 2: Loop through each file in the directory and process files that have the .asc extension.
